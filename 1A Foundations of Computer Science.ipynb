    "- Divide to partition the input into two sublists:\n",
    "  * those _at most_ $a$ in value\n",

    "Quicksort was invented by Sir Anthony Hoare, who works at Microsoft Research,\n",
    "Cambridge.  Quicksort works by _divide and conquer,_ a basic algorithm design\n",
    "principle.  Quicksort chooses from the input some value $a$, called the\n",
